    - 2nd best solution
    - Faster than HTTP calls
    - Eat up system resources
    - Easy to maintain
    - Best for Realtime applications, games and financials services etc...
    - Horizontal Scaling, load balancing is possible through third party tools like NginX and HAProxy etc...
3) Messaging Queues
    - One of the best solutions [Kafka, Rabbitmq etc...]
    - One of fastest and widely used
    - Horizontal Scaling, Cluster, Failover everything is out of box and simple

For each option describe what are the cases the solution fits best?
1) HTTP - Good for budget client
2) Socket - Realtime applications
